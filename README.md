# Hotel Website

This repository contains the source code for our hotel website, which offers various functionalities to provide a seamless experience for our users. Below is an overview of the different pages and the tools we used to develop this website.

## Pages

### Home
The Home page provides an overview of our website, including information about the hotel and the facilities we offer. It serves as the entry point for users to explore our services.

### Rooms
The Rooms page showcases the different types of rooms available in our hotel. Users can view the details and features of each room. To book a room, users need to sign up and log in so we can store their information in our database.

### Contact Us
On the Contact Us page, users can reach out to us by sending a message. We will respond to their inquiries as soon as possible.

### About Us
The About Us page provides information about our team members and the story behind our hotel.

### Sign Up
The Sign Up page allows new users to create an account. This is necessary for booking rooms and other personalized services.

### Login
The Login page enables existing users to access their accounts and make reservations or contact us.

## Tools Used

### GitHub
We used GitHub for version control and collaboration. Each team member committed their work to the repository, and once the work was completed of each week, we merged all files into a main branch and make the new branch for the another week.

### Trello(Team Gantt, Burndown chart)
Trello was our planning tool. It included user stories, to-do lists, backlog items, and completed tasks. We tracked progress using a burndown chart and managed tasks with a Gantt chart to set start and end dates, ensuring all tasks were completed on time.
